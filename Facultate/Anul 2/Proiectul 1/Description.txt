-------------------------------- SUMMARY ------------------------------------

This is a website built as a project for college. I had to get familiar with 
using the basic semantic tags from HTML and HTML5, the selectors from CSS and 
using the event handlers in JavaScript.

I decided to create a website imitating an e-learning website, based on the 
subject of geography. The name chosen was "LearnIT", because I thought I could
extend it later to more than geography information.

The front page is a basic one where you have a navbar with all the options to 
navigate to. The user is also welcome by a message and he can choose to view
one of the main parts of the website:

	- "Romania";
	- "World".

I decided to separate these two because it seemed like a good idea to promote 
my home country as well.

--------------------------------- WORLD -----------------------------------

If you choose the world option ( from either the navbar or the front page menu )
you are prompted to a list of continents to choose from. Since these was a college project, I did not implement all the continents. For now the user can browse
through a few European countries.

So, if the Europe option is chosen, a table is displayed with a few countries to
pick from. If the user selects one country from that table, he is prompted to a 
template page with some information about that country and a photo gallery. This
page is responsive according to the resolution of the viewer's screen.

-------------------------------- ROMANIA ---------------------------------

For now, the Romania page contains a gallery of representative photos of the 
country. This page is responsive as well.

------------------------------- BIBLIOGRAPHY -----------------------------

This website was created mostly with the help of the following websites:

	- w3schools.com;
	- stackoverflow.com;
	- youtube.com.

I have not used any framework ( that was the purpose of this task ) or code from
somewhere else.

All the images used were taken from google images.
